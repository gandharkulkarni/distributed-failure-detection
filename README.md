# distributed-failure-detection
Developed a node failure detection system using Golang. Employed overlay networks and heartbeat signals for efficient communication. Components seamlessly exchanged data, adapting thresholds for accurate failure identification to enhance overall reliability by effectively managing and responding to node failures in dynamic distributed environments.
